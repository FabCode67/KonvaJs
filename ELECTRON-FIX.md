# Fixing Electron Build Issues

You're encountering a 404 error when trying to download the Electron binary. This is because the URL for Electron version 26.0.0 is incorrect or the version is not available at the specified location.

## Solution: Update Electron Version

I've created an `update-electron.bat` script that will:

1. Uninstall the current Electron version
2. Install Electron version 25.9.0 (a stable, available version)
3. Clear the npm cache to ensure a clean download

## Steps to Fix the Issue:

1. Run the update script:
   ```
   update-electron.bat
   ```

2. Build the executable again:
   ```
   build-exe.bat
   ```

## What Changes Were Made:

1. Changed Electron version from 26.0.0 to 25.9.0 in package.json
2. Updated the Electron mirror URL in .npmrc to use the official Electron mirrors
3. Added a note to the build script to run the update script if 404 errors persist

## Manual Fix (if the script doesn't work):

If you prefer to fix this manually, you can run these commands:

```bash
npm uninstall electron
npm install --save-dev electron@25.9.0
npm cache clean --force
```

Then update your .npmrc file to contain:
```
electron_mirror=https://electronjs.org/mirrors/electron/
```

## Additional Troubleshooting:

If you're still encountering issues, you can try:

1. Using an even older version of Electron (e.g., 24.8.8)
2. Using Electron Forge instead of Electron Builder
3. Building without the electron_mirror setting (remove the .npmrc file)
