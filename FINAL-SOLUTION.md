# Canvas Drawing App - Final Solution

Based on the errors you've been encountering, I've created a simpler alternative approach to package your Electron application.

## Option 1: Try the Fix-Electron Script

I've created a new script that:
1. Removes the problematic .npmrc file
2. Installs a known stable version of Electron (21.4.4)
3. Updates Electron Builder to a compatible version
4. Attempts to build your application

Run this script:
```
fix-electron.bat
```

## Option 2: Build a Portable App Manually (Recommended)

If Option 1 doesn't work, I've created a script to manually build a portable version of your app without using electron-builder:

1. Run this script:
   ```
   build-portable.bat
   ```

2. This will:
   - Build the Next.js static files
   - Create a `dist/electron-app` folder
   - Copy all necessary files there
   - Create a simple start.bat file

3. To run the app:
   - Go to `dist/electron-app`
   - Double-click on `start.bat`

## Why This Approach Works

This approach avoids the complexities of electron-builder and directly packages your application as a portable app. It doesn't create an installer, but it creates a self-contained folder with everything needed to run your application.

## Testing Your Application

1. Make sure the Next.js build works:
   ```
   npm run build
   ```

2. Run the portable app creation script:
   ```
   build-portable.bat
   ```

3. Test the app by running the start.bat file in the dist/electron-app folder

## Alternative Options

If you really need an installer:

1. Try using [Electron Forge](https://www.electronforge.io/) instead of Electron Builder
2. Use a much older version of Electron (e.g., 13.x.x)
3. Create a ZIP archive of the portable app folder

## Final Notes

The key issue you've been facing is with Electron's packaging and distribution tools. The simplest and most reliable solution is to manually create a portable application, which is what the `build-portable.bat` script does.

Remember that users will need to have Node.js installed to run the portable app with the start.bat approach.
