# Final Troubleshooting Guide

Based on your latest feedback, the application is starting but then immediately closing. This suggests there might be an error during startup that's causing Electron to crash.

## I've Created Multiple Solutions:

### 1. Debug Start Script
The `debug-start.bat` file will:
- Run the application
- Capture all output to a log file
- Keep the window open even if there's an error
- Show you the error code

### 2. Super Simple Build
The `super-simple-build.bat` script creates an extremely simplified version:
- Uses a basic Electron setup with minimal dependencies
- Opens DevTools automatically to show any errors
- Uses a simplified package.json with just Electron

## How to Troubleshoot:

1. First, try the debug version:
   ```
   debug-start.bat
   ```
   - Check the debug-log.txt file to see any error messages

2. If that doesn't help, build the super-simple version:
   ```
   super-simple-build.bat
   ```
   - Navigate to dist/simple-electron-canvas
   - Run start.bat

## Common Issues and Solutions:

1. **Path Problems**: 
   - The application can't find the HTML files or resources
   - Solution: The super-simple build uses absolute paths with error logging

2. **Missing Dependencies**:
   - Node modules aren't properly installed
   - Solution: The debug script explicitly logs installation issues

3. **Electron Version Compatibility**:
   - Some Electron versions may have issues
   - Solution: The simplified build uses a known stable version (21.4.4)

4. **File Permissions**:
   - Files might be locked or have insufficient permissions
   - Solution: Try extracting the ZIP to a different location (not Program Files)

## Last Resort Options:

If none of these solutions work, you could:

1. **Use a portable Electron executable**:
   - Package the app with electron-packager to create a standalone .exe

2. **Create a simple HTML version**:
   - Eliminate Electron entirely and use a basic HTML file that can open in any browser

3. **Try a different Electron packaging tool**:
   - Tools like electron-forge or nativefier might work better

## Future Improvements:

If you get the application working, here are some enhancements to consider:

1. Add more drawing tools (shapes, text)
2. Implement undo/redo functionality
3. Add layer support for more complex drawings
4. Create a proper installer with NSIS or similar tool
